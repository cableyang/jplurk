= The origination of jPlurk =

jPlurk v1 is created by askeing (about Feb, 2009). 
The motivation is that plurk's user need a tool can support a daily `plurk' 
to prevent the karma from reducing (inspiring by xdite's karma keeping plan).
ChingYiChan.tw join this project later. He provides some design suggestion for jPlurk development.

= The evolution of jPlurk =

The jPlurk v1 and other unofficial plurk api implement plurk function 
by parsing html and pretend the web browser (submiting forms, keeping cookies, etc).
Until plurk official api is released (5, Dec, 2009), we decide to renew our project to using the stardard ways.
Stop the jPlurk v1 and propose the new architecture of jPlurk.

jPlurk v2 use official api, all implementation can be found in the PlurkActionSheet class.
We use this class to map official api and java source code. 
It keep the metadata for uri, required fields, request method, connection type. All are the annotation of a method:

{{{
@Meta(uri = "/FriendsFans/getFriendsByOffset", require = { "api_key", "user_id" })
@Validation({ @Validator(field = "offset", validator = NonNegativeIntegerValidator.class) })
public HttpUriRequest getFriendsByOffset(Map<String, String> params)
                                throws PlurkException {
                return prepare("getFriendsByOffset", params);
}
}}}

= The convention of jPlurk v2 design =

 * naming are almost mapping to official api 
 * PlurkClient will return either JSONObject or JSONArrayObject
 * null is returned, if any excpetions raising or http status is not 200 OK
